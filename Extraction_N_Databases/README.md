Fullstack SMS Data Processing Application
Assignment Overview
Here is the Link of Documentation :

This project focuses on creating and implementing a comprehensive full-stack application designed to handle SMS data in XML format. The system will clean, categorize, and store the data in a relational database, while also providing a user-friendly front-end for analysis and visualization.

The dataset consists of around 1600 SMS messages from MTN MoMo, a mobile payment service provider in Rwanda. The primary objective is to extract valuable insights from the data and display them on an interactive dashboard for easy exploration.

Learning Objectives By completing this assignment, you will:

Apply data cleaning and categorization techniques to extract insights from raw data. Design and implement a relational database schema for structured data storage. Develop a backend to handle database operations and integrate it with a frontend application. Build an interactive and user-friendly dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Demonstrate end-to-end problem-solving skills in fullstack application development. Deliverables Python/JS Scripts: For data cleaning, processing, and populating the database. Database Schema: Relational database design for SMS data storage. Frontend Interface: A dashboard to visualize and interact with the data. Documentation: A report explaining the approach, design decisions, and functionality of the application.

Assignment Tasks

Data Cleaning and Processing (Backend) Data Extraction Parse the provided XML file using JavaScript or Python libraries (e.g., xml.etree.ElementTree, lxml, BeautifulSoup). Extract and categorize SMS messages into the following types: Incoming Money Payments to Code Holders Transfers to Mobile Numbers Bank Deposits Airtime Bill Payments Cash Power Bill Payments Transactions Initiated by Third Parties Withdrawal from Agents Bank Transfers Internet and Voice Bundle Purchases Other

Database Design and Implementation Relational Database Design a schema that captures all relevant fields for each transaction type. Use SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL for database implementation. Data Insertion Develop a script to insert the cleaned and categorized data into the database. Ensure data integrity and handle duplicates or conflicting entries.

Frontend Dashboard Development Dashboard Requirements Build an interactive dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


# When you run the provided Python files in the specified order, here's what happens in each step:

1. hub.py:
This script reads an XML file (modified_sms.xml) and extracts data based on specified key categories.
It organizes this extracted data and saves it into a JSON file (process.json).
Additionally, it calculates the total amount of money under each category and stores this information in another JSON file (balances.json).

2. balances.py:
This script takes the balances.json file created by hub.py.
It creates a database table structure to store the data contained within (balances.json). This involve using a database library (SQLite or SQLAlchemy) to define and create the necessary tables.

3. process.py:
This script reads from process.json, which was generated by hub.py.
It reformats and extracts the data further, producing a more detailed JSON file (update_process.json). This involves elaborating on the data structure to make it easier to work with.

4. data_base_momo.py:
Finally, this script uses the newly created (update_process.json) file from process.py.
It creates a database table corresponding to the key categories found in (update_process.json), likely involving the same database operations as balances.py. This involve using a database library (SQLite or SQLAlchemy) to define and create the necessary tables.

Summary of the Workflow:
Data Extraction: hub.py extracts and organizes data from XML and computes totals.
Database Creation: balances.py and data_base_momo.py create database tables for the financial data and detailed sms data, respectively.
Data Formatting: process.py enhances the detail of the data for better usability.
