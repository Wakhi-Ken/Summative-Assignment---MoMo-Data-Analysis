When you run the provided Python files in the specified order, here's what happens in each step:

1. hub.py:
This script reads an XML file (modified_sms.xml) and extracts data based on specified key categories.
It organizes this extracted data and saves it into a JSON file (process.json).
Additionally, it calculates the total amount of money under each category and stores this information in another JSON file (balances.json).

2. balances.py:
This script takes the balances.json file created by hub.py.
It creates a database table structure to store the data contained within (balances.json). This involve using a database library (SQLite or SQLAlchemy) to define and create the necessary tables.

3. process.py:
This script reads from process.json, which was generated by hub.py.
It reformats and extracts the data further, producing a more detailed JSON file (update_process.json). This involves elaborating on the data structure to make it easier to work with.

4. data_base_momo.py:
Finally, this script uses the newly created (update_process.json) file from process.py.
It creates a database table corresponding to the key categories found in (update_process.json), likely involving the same database operations as balances.py. This involve using a database library (SQLite or SQLAlchemy) to define and create the necessary tables.

Summary of the Workflow:
Data Extraction: hub.py extracts and organizes data from XML and computes totals.
Database Creation: balances.py and data_base_momo.py create database tables for the financial data and detailed sms data, respectively.
Data Formatting: process.py enhances the detail of the data for better usability.
